# Jay Language

As a coder more than 6 years, I always hausted by the idea that I need make a programming language by myself. Though I known that I spend many years to study Logistics Engeering, my coding experience more on transportation service for enterprise, I know little about how to make a programing language, but I just could not stop that idea.

So I spend weeks to read the <<The definitive ANTLR 4 Reference>>, it helps me a lot, I find that I could make a Lexer and Parser that with little knowlege about the that, I only need to master the RegExpression, it is easier than I thought before. When to I start to make a language, it is not easy, 3 days is not enough, So I searched the Github, the ATSL(https://github.com/Aerodlyn/ATSL) is very great, I find that the main task is finished already, so I want to depends on that and make my own schema. Many thanks to Aerodlyn, he did great job.

# Guide
You can refer to guide of ANTLR to install the software(https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/getting-started.md). You can althougn use the gen.sh at Jay project to install the software on Ubuntu.
If you change the J.g4, use gen.sh to generate the language code runtime. When you change the source code, you can use all.sh to generate the language code and compile them and do testing.

# Currently, the function should declare first then call it, I will add check stage before execute the program.

The init commit is my 3 days work, enjoys it.
