# Jay Language

As a coder more than 6 years, I always hausted by the idea that I need make a programming language by myself. Though I known that I spend many years to study Logistics Engeering, my coding experience more on transportation service for enterprise, I know little about how to make a programing language, but I just could not stop that idea.

So I spend weeks to read the <<The definitive ANTLR 4 Reference>>, it helps me a lot, I find that I could make a Lexer and Parser that with little knowlege about the that, I only need to master the RegExpression, it is easier than I thought before. When to I start to make a language, it is not easy, 3 days is not enough, So I searched the Github, the ATSL(https://github.com/Aerodlyn/ATSL) is very great, I find that the main task is finished already, so I want to depends on that and make my own schema. Many thanks to Aerodlyn, he did great job.

The init commit is my 3 days work, enjoys it.
